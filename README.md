## Run in local setup
1. Clone the branch `dev-django` of this repository.
```python
git clone -b dev-django https://github.com/Humairajahan/MarkIt.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate the environment.

```python
python -m venv <ENV>
source <ENV>/bin/activate
```
This should do it! 

You can get out of the virtual environment by simply deactivating it.
```python
deactivate
``` 

3. Install the requirements.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!-- 4. Follow through this step in case you want to create a new django project.
```python
django-admin startproject <PROJECT>
```

5. Now run the whole django application.
```python
# Run our django application
python backend_server/manage.py runserver

# Run your own django application
python <PROJECT>/manage.py runserver
```

6. You can create new applications under the hood of the django project you just created.
```python
python backend_server/manage.py startapp routers
``` -->

4. Now run our django application in your setup.

```python
python backend_server/manage.py runserver
```
